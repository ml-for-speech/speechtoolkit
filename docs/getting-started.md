# Getting Started

## Installation

Installing SpeechToolkit is quite easy!

### Basic Installation

Use this for testing, development, etc. Note that it will download packages for *all* models (text-to-speech, voice cloning, etc), so it will be much slower and larger than downloading task-specific versions.

If you're unsure of which one to download, you should use basic installation.

```
pip install speechtoolkit[all]
```

### Advanced Installation

For production deployment.

Install SpeechToolkit core without any extras:

```
pip install speechtoolkit
```

## Basic Usage

Now that you've successfully installed SpeechToolkit, it's time to run some models! Head over to the [examples](examples.md) page to see some basic examples or read the [usage guide](usage.md) for detailed documentation.
